 To enhance the user experience and improve productivity, we need to develop a File Management System for Android within the Hexnode ecosystem. This feature will allow users to manage files efficiently on their enrolled devices while ensuring compliance with security policies. The key functionalities include: File Browsing: Users should be able to navigate through files and directories on their devices. File Upload & Download: Enable seamless uploading and downloading of files, with support for cloud integration (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive). File Access Permissions: Implement granular permission controls to restrict file access based on user roles and policies. Remote File Management: Admins should be able to push or remove files remotely via the MDM console. File Encryption & Security: Ensure secure storage and transfer of files to prevent unauthorized access. Logging & Reporting: Maintain logs of file operations for compliance and auditing purposes. This feature should integrate seamlessly with Hexnode’s existing device management capabilities, ensuring security and usability while providing a smooth file management experience. Acceptance Criteria: Users can browse, upload, and download files on their managed devices. Admins can enforce file access policies and permissions. Remote file management capabilities are available via the Hexnode MDM console. Files are encrypted at rest and in transit to ensure security. The system maintains logs for all file operations, accessible via an admin panel. Compatibility is ensured across various Android versions.

 Several users have reported issues during iOS device enrollment through Hexnode’s MDM platform. The problems primarily occur during the initial setup and profile installation process, leading to failed enrollments or incomplete configuration. The affected users experience one or more of the following issues: Stuck at "Awaiting final configuration" – Devices do not proceed beyond this step. MDM profile installation fails intermittently – Some devices fail to install the MDM profile without a clear error message. Device does not appear in Hexnode after enrollment – Enrollment completes on the device, but it does not register in the admin panel. Incorrect restrictions applied – Some enrolled devices are receiving incorrect configuration profiles or missing expected restrictions. Supervised mode not applying correctly – Devices that should be in supervised mode after enrollment are not enforcing the expected policies. These issues impact user experience, delay device setup, and could cause compliance problems for enterprises relying on managed iOS devices. Acceptance Criteria: Investigate and resolve the issue causing enrollment to get stuck at "Awaiting final configuration." Fix the intermittent MDM profile installation failures. Ensure enrolled devices consistently appear in the admin panel. Validate and correct configuration profiles applied during enrollment. Ensure supervised mode is correctly applied where required. Test across multiple iOS versions to ensure compatibility.

 Description:  Develop a kiosk solution for Hexnode that provides a secure, user-friendly, and fully managed environment. The kiosk should support single-app and multi-app modes, ensuring seamless access to designated applications while restricting unauthorized usage. Key features include remote configuration, device lockdown, UI customization, and integration with Hexnode’s MDM capabilities. The solution should be optimized for performance, security, and ease of deployment. Acceptance Criteria: Users can only access approved applications. Kiosk mode can be enabled/disabled remotely via Hexnode. UI customization options for branding and user experience. Device lockdown to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. Comprehensive logging and reporting for admin monitoring.

    "title": "Could the bootstrap documentation be wrong in its explanation in this section \"Remove from Map\"?",
    "body": "I have been reading the bootstrap documentation, so I have arrived in this section [Remove from Map](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/sass/#remove-from-map)\r\n\r\nIt says To remove colors from `$theme-colors`, or any other map, use `map-remove`. Be aware you must insert `$theme-colors` between our requirements just after its definition in variables and before its usage in maps:\r\n\r\nand then provides this code \r\n\r\n```\r\n// Required\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions\";\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables\";\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables-dark\";\r\n\r\n$theme-colors: map-remove($theme-colors, \"info\", \"light\", \"dark\");\r\n\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/maps\";\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins\";\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/root\";\r\n\r\n// Optional\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/reboot\";\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/type\";\r\n// etc\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut remember bootstrap's `$theme-colors` map is defined with the `!default` flag. \r\n![theme-color](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72dd6f33-2d96-4083-b7ed-69f6cd552d65)\r\n\r\nThis means the value is only assigned if the variable isn't already defined. This means that from the above code provided in the bootstrap documenation by the time the `map-remove()` line is executed, `$theme-colors` is already defined. Therefore the `!default` flag prevents the `map-remove()` from having any effect because the variable already has a value. \r\n\r\nI have been chatting with Gemini 1.5 Pro and it says to remove keys from a map with !default, you must define your modified map before importing the file that contains the `!default` definition. Here's the correct way to remove `\"info\"`, `\"light\"`, and `\"dark\"` from `$theme-colors`: \r\n\r\n```\r\n// Your custom.scss\r\n$theme-colors: (\r\n  \"primary\": map-get($theme-colors, \"primary\"), // Keep \"primary\"\r\n  \"secondary\": map-get($theme-colors, \"secondary\"), // Keep \"secondary\"\r\n  // ... other colors you want to keep\r\n); // \"info\", \"light\", and \"dark\" are now excluded\r\n\r\n\r\n// Required\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions\";\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables\"; // Bootstrap's variables are imported *after* your custom definition\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables-dark\";\r\n// ... rest of your imports\r\n```\r\n\r\nGemini 1.5 Pro also says if the map you're trying to modify was originally defined with the `!default` flag (as is common in Bootstrap), you can't directly modify it using `map-remove()`. You'll need to create a new map with the desired key-value pairs. \r\n\r\nCould there be an error in the bootstrap documentation, or is it possible that I am misunderstanding this section?",

    "body": "Hello Bootstrap Community,\r\n\r\nI am working on an Angular 19 project where I am trying to customize the default Bootstrap theme using Sass. However, with the recent Sass updates, the @import rule has been deprecated and replaced by @use and @forward, which has led to a lot of issues when trying to customize Bootstrap styles.\r\n\r\nHere is what I have done so far:\r\n\r\nI have installed Bootstrap via npm and tried to import the Bootstrap SCSS files into my custom SCSS file.\r\nI started by overriding Bootstrap’s default variables before importing the rest of the Bootstrap SCSS files, as recommended in the documentation.\r\nHowever, I am facing issues with deprecated features, specifically the global mix() function and @import rules in Bootstrap’s SCSS files, which are preventing the project from compiling correctly.\r\nI’ve attempted to switch to @use and @forward in my SCSS files to comply with the new Sass syntax, but I am still encountering errors like the Undefined mixin _assert-ascending in Bootstrap’s SCSS files, and the deprecation warnings related to @import.\r\nDespite multiple attempts to resolve this, I am still facing issues with Bootstrap 5 and the latest version of Sass. I would really appreciate it if someone could guide me on how to properly customize Bootstrap 5 in my Angular 19 project, while avoiding these deprecated features and making use of @use/@forward.\r\n\r\nTried the order as well :\r\n@import '../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions';\r\n@import '../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables';\r\n@import '../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins';\r\n\r\nHere are the errors I’m encountering:\r\n\r\nWarnings about deprecated @import and mix() functions.\r\nError: Undefined mixin _assert-ascending.\r\nOther compatibility issues when trying to use the new Sass syntax.\r\nHas anyone faced similar issues or has any recommendations on how I can properly customize Bootstrap with the new Sass features in Angular 19?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!",

    "title": "Use meta.apply and meta.get-mixin to allow \"overriding\" bootstrap mixins like button-variant",
    "body": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI've got a common case. Most of the time, I need to change the way mixins like button-variant handle the variants generation.\r\nIn other words, I need to override the mixin. But, for now, the best solution I came with is to replace the original scss/_buttons.scss.\r\n\r\nBut what if the name of the mixin to apply is a variable ? This can be achieved through the sass:meta built-in module. I've just test it, It works pretty well and I think it's a nice solution. Also, applied properly, there would be no breaking changes.\r\n\r\nSo, let's take the button-variant case. We could add a scss/_mixins-variables.scss file containing this:\r\n```scss\r\n$mixin-button-variant: \"button-variant\"  !default;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIn scss/_buttons.scss, we actually have that:\r\n```scss\r\n@each $color, $value in $theme-colors {\r\n  .btn-#{$color} {\r\n    @if $color == \"light\" {\r\n      @include button-variant(\r\n        $value,\r\n        $value,\r\n        $hover-background: shade-color($value, $btn-hover-bg-shade-amount),\r\n        $hover-border: shade-color($value, $btn-hover-border-shade-amount),\r\n        $active-background: shade-color($value, $btn-active-bg-shade-amount),\r\n        $active-border: shade-color($value, $btn-active-border-shade-amount)\r\n      );\r\n    } @else if $color == \"dark\" {\r\n      @include button-variant(\r\n        $value,\r\n        $value,\r\n        $hover-background: tint-color($value, $btn-hover-bg-tint-amount),\r\n        $hover-border: tint-color($value, $btn-hover-border-tint-amount),\r\n        $active-background: tint-color($value, $btn-active-bg-tint-amount),\r\n        $active-border: tint-color($value, $btn-active-border-tint-amount)\r\n      );\r\n    } @else {\r\n      @include button-variant($value, $value);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nInstead we could do something like this:\r\n```scss\r\n@use \"sass:meta\";\r\n\r\n@if $mixin-button-variant {\r\n  @each $color, $value in $theme-colors {\r\n    .btn-#{$color} {\r\n      @include meta.apply(meta.get-mixin($mixin-button-variant),\r\n        $value,\r\n        $value\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nWhen using Bootstrap in a project, if my need is to change the default parameter values for instance, I can do a very simple thing:\r\n```scss\r\n$mixin-button-variant: \"custom-button-variant\";\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n@mixin custom-button-variant(\r\n  $background,\r\n  $border,\r\n  $color: red,\r\n  $hover-background: red,\r\n  $hover-border: red,\r\n  $hover-color: red,\r\n  $active-background: red,\r\n  $active-border: red,\r\n  $active-color: red,\r\n  $disabled-background: red,\r\n  $disabled-border: red,\r\n  $disabled-color: red\r\n) {\r\n  @include button-variant($background, $border, $color, $hover-background, $hover-border, $hover-color, $active-background, $active-border, $active-color, $disabled-background, $disabled-border, $disabled-color);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt also offers a simple way to disable the variants generation, by setting:\r\n```scss\r\n$mixin-button-variant: null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, what do you think ? Maybe you already thought of it. For my concern, it would resolve a lot of my problems.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day !",

Once a new version is available, Bootstrap will automatically pick up the update when dependencies are refreshed.\r\n\r\nThat said, there's **no real cause for concern** - this package is only used in Bootstrap's **development** and is listed under `devDependencies`, meaning it has no impact on the final Bootstrap library.

When using Vite, the way static assets like images are handled might differ, and it's possible that Vite's dev server is either not serving the images correctly or they're being incorrectly referenced. Bootstrap itself won't affect image visibility by default, nor does it alter how images should be displayed. The issue seems to be more about how Vite handles your asset paths and MIME types.",

You might need to set up a custom resolve that might look like the following:\r\n```jsx\r\nimport path from 'path';\r\n\r\nexport default defineConfig({\r\n//  ... the rest of your configuration\r\nresolve: {\r\n    alias: {\r\n      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn CSS, paths would look like the following:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbackground: url(@/assets/icons/icon-time.svg) no-repeat;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n- Check the `base` value in Vite config\r\n- Use path aliases and absolute path imports when possible\r\n- Update path resolve in Vite configuration",

    "body": "Let me clarify.\r\nI work on a wordpress project, I don't have access to any compilers like webpack or able to use import.\r\nI'm trying to transition to bs5. However, one thing I liked about BS4 is that if I need scrollspy just in a certain template, I can add util.js + scrollspy.js and mimify them. This gives me a **9kb** JS file. vs the **83kb** file that is the V4.6 bundle. I'm trying to optimize my site as much as possible.\r\n\r\nHow can I do this in bs5? I know if I use webpack I can use export and what not but I don't have access to these ES5 rules in normal javascript. \r\n\r\nOn the documentation it says \"Plugins can be included individually (using Bootstrap’s individual js/dist/*.js), or all at once using bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js (don’t include both).\"\r\nI tried including modal.js from dist and it says \"Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module\".\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?",

        "body": "For what its worth I actually figured out how to do it and compile it (although I haven't found anything about this in the docs so its not as straightforward)\r\n1. Download the BS5 source files.\r\n2. Install npm \r\n3. Go to /build/build-plugins.js in the bsPlugins constant and comment all the plugins you don't need for example: \r\n`const bsPlugins = {\r\n  // Data: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/dom/data.js'),\r\n  // EventHandler: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/dom/event-handler.js'),\r\n  // Manipulator: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/dom/manipulator.js'),\r\n  // SelectorEngine: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/dom/selector-engine.js'),\r\n  // Alert: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/alert.js'),\r\n  // Base: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/base-component.js'),\r\n  // Button: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/button.js'),\r\n  Carousel: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/carousel.js'),\r\n  // Collapse: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/collapse.js'),\r\n  // Dropdown: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/dropdown.js'),\r\n  // Modal: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/modal.js')\r\n  // Popover: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/popover.js'),\r\n  // ScrollSpy: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/scrollspy.js'),\r\n  // Tab: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/tab.js'),\r\n  // Toast: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/toast.js'),\r\n  // Tooltip: path.resolve(__dirname, '../js/src/tooltip.js')\r\n}`\r\n4. Go to /js/index.esm.js and /js/index.umd.js and do the same as above, comment out everything you don't need.\r\n5. in your CMD run npm run dist\r\n\r\nAnd now the bundle you want will be inside dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js\r\n\r\nThis bs js only has the Carousel javascript now, and you can include it normally in a non webpack project <script src=\"bundle.js\"> etc...\r\n\r\nIt would help a ton if this is explained more clearly in the docs, stressing this again, you can't just use the /src js files since they contain import statements ( in bs4 you could do that )",

For example, I've continued merging patches into v5.3.4 since it hasn't been released yet, but it could have been released earlier as-is, with additional patches handled in subsequent v5.3.x releases. In my opinion, it's more a matter of balancing personal commitments and the time available to contribute to OSS and Bootstrap. The core team is relatively small, and this project has a large volume of issues, discussions, and interactions to manage.\r\n\r\nI'm also working on simplifying the release process to make it easier to release updates more frequently in the future and avoid situations like the one we're experiencing with v5.3.4.\r\n\r\nRegarding the deprecation warnings, these can't be addressed in a patch release because fixing them requires a significant refactor of Bootstrap's codebase. You can follow the ongoing work on this here: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/41112.\r\n\r\nHope this helps clarify things :)",

So all the colors that change are not from Bootstrap actually.\r\nIn `v5.3.0`, there's a solid background color for the tables so your actual system (not really based on Bootstrap for the bg and text colors) will only change what's outside of the table.\r\n\r\nIn `v5.3.0` and `v5.3.0-alpha3` the color modes rely on `data-bs-theme`. If you want only to react to the system's light and dark modes, you need to build Bootstrap with Sass and set `$color-mode-type: media-query;` (see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/color-modes/#building-with-sass).\r\n\r\nWithout recompiling Bootstrap, there will be another possibility in JS to simulate our \"auto\" mode in the documentation based on https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/site/static/docs/5.3/assets/js/color-modes.js but I wouldn't recommend this approach.",

Bootstrap breakpoints apply the largest matching class, so as long as your viewport width is above 992px, the lg rules will apply, regardless of whether you're in portrait or landscape (see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#grid-options).\r\n\r\nIf you want a specific rendering for this device, you could adjust by having orientation media queries (for portrait or landscape):\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@media (orientation: landscape) {\r\n  .my-class {\r\n    /* Custom styles for landscape mode */\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n@media (orientation: portrait) {\r\n  .my-class {\r\n    /* Custom styles for portrait mode */\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor add custom breakpoints, something like:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@media (max-width: 1002px) {\r\n  .my-class {\r\n    /* Override styles for narrow landscape widths */\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

I noticed you’ve already opened https://github.com/zostera/django-bootstrap5/issues/735 in their repository, which is a great step since I haven’t personally worked with Django Bootstrap.\r\n\r\nHere are a few suggestions to help debug the problem:\r\n- Test whether other `data-bs-*` attributes work as expected (instantiate an accordion for instance). This can help determine if the issue is with Django Bootstrap’s handling of the global `data-bs-*` system or specifically with the toggle buttons.\r\n- Use your browser’s developer tools to check the console for any warning or error messages that might give clues about what’s going wrong.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could try to create a reproducible project for folks to help with [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) for example.",

So we would like to use only `my-2`, and in the CSS the default is 2 spacers, but on mobile make it half, so on desktop it has to be `16px/1rem`, but on mobile `8px/0.5rem`.

    "title": "Better alternative for explainig how to achieve LTR and RTL at the same time in the docs",
    "body": "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI am seeing that this is a recurrent topic in Bootstrap discussions: #36170, #37877, #33488, #39512, in the `RTLCSS` repository: [#314](https://github.com/MohammadYounes/rtlcss/issues/314), [#301](https://github.com/MohammadYounes/rtlcss/issues/301) and even [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71746320/2035354). On both places it is mentioned one of the plugins that I maintain: [postcss-rtlcss](https://github.com/elchininet/postcss-rtlcss).\r\n\r\n`postcss-rtlcss` does exactly this. It uses [RTLCSS](https://rtlcss.com/) behind the scenes to compile a CSS with both directions at the same time with the intention of changing the `dir` attribute of the HTML (or a specific class) and make the layout to change from LTR to RTL (or vice versa) without the necessity of loading an extra stylesheet.\r\n\r\nUsing `postcss-rtlcss` is not only an easy task to perform (just adding another plugin to the postcss config) but it also solves the third limitation mentioned [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/rtl/#ltr-and-rtl-at-the-same-time) and it mitigates in a great level the second one, because it doesn‘t double the size of the CSS. Only declarations that are affected by direction are the ones that are prefixed. Comparing [bootstrap.min.css with both directions](https://github.com/elchininet/bootstrap-bidi/blob/5f5ec3f0341bfb9ba9aa5f6a1d1600e9e5c39cf7/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css) (280 KB) with [bootstrap.min.css with a single direction](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/99562ba37c26aded816fa610210057518e13babb/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css) (227 KB) it can be noticed that the increment is a 23%.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the proposed solution works overriding the LTR styles with the RTL ones, this will bring issues sooner or later because if a `left` declaration is overridden by a `right` one, the previous one should be cancelled, otherwise one will end up with both classes in RTL:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.test {\r\n    padding-left: 10px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.rtl .test {\r\n    padding-right: 10px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn RTL `.test` will have padding `10px` on both sides, so [the previous padding-left should be cancelled](https://elchininet.github.io/postcss-rtlcss/#65e70db09f214).\r\n\r\nBut even doing that cancelling operation, overriding styles could bring multiple issues (this is mentioned in the README of `postcss-rtlcss` in [the section relative to override modes](https://github.com/elchininet/postcss-rtlcss#output-using-the-override-mode) in the subsection `Disadvantage of the override methods`). It is better to use [the combined mode](https://github.com/elchininet/postcss-rtlcss#output-using-the-combined-mode-default) with [the safeBothPrefix option](https://github.com/elchininet/postcss-rtlcss#safebothprefix) enabled to cover cases [in which the specificity of the prefixed rules could affect other rules that have been not flipped](https://elchininet.github.io/postcss-rtlcss/#65e710b8a8ca5).\r\n\r\nI have built [the Bootstrap site using both directions](https://elchininet.github.io/bootstrap-bidi/) in `combined` mode with `safeBothPrefix` option enabled, and added a selector at the end of the header to switch between LTR and RTL and add the proper `dir` attribute to the HTML, so you can check what `postcss-rtlcss` does with a real life example.\r\n\r\nMentioning this in the [LTR and RTL at the same time](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/rtl/#ltr-and-rtl-at-the-same-time) section will help a lot of users who are searching for the same and it will provide them with a better and more straightforward alternative.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you find it valuable 🙂\r\n\r\nRegards",

    "body": "Related to https://github.com/orgs/twbs/discussions/39551 but I think different enough.\r\nI'd really like to be able to customize named colors ($primary, $secondary, etc) based on the selected theme with data-bs-theme. It seems as though re-defining a named variable inside a [data-bs-theme=\"custom\"] does nothing, but defining it outside of that works fine for me.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to have different values of named colors like $primary or other variables depending on the current data-bs-theme attribute or is that not yet possible in 5.3.3?\r\nIf not, is my only option to manually override a ton of styles like background-color in .btn-primary and other components that would be based on $primary?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n```\r\n// $primary: limegreen; // Works great if commented in.\r\n\r\n[data-bs-theme=\"custom\"] {\r\n    // Arbitrary colors for testing -- None of these variables do anything to change buttons across the website.\r\n    --bs-primary: #ff0000;\r\n    --bs-secondary: #0000ff;\r\n\r\n    --bs-primary-color: #ffd800;\r\n    --bs-secondary-color: #b6ff00;\r\n    \r\n    $blue: var(--bs-btn-bg);\r\n    $primary: #ff69b4;\r\n    $secondary: var(--bs-primary);\r\n     // likewise other variables like $link-decoration don't matter if defined in here\r\n\t\r\n    // Class overrides that works fine but are tedious\r\n    .btn-info {\r\n        background-color: var(--bs-white);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .input-group-text {\r\n        background-color: #333\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n```",

        "body": "There’s a misunderstanding of how Sass variables work in general (not only with Bootstrap).\r\n\r\nWhen you define Sass variables like `$primary`, `$secondary`, or `$blue` inside a CSS selector or pseudo-selector like `[data-bs-theme=\"custom\"]`, these variables are locally scoped. This means they won't be available outside those `{ }`. \r\n\r\nThis works because $primary is defined locally but at the same place\r\n```scss\r\n// SCSS\r\nselectorA {\r\n    $primary: #ff69b4;\r\n    color: $primary;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis works too because $primary is defined globally and is available everywhere\r\n```scss\r\n// SCSS\r\n$primary: #ff69b4;\r\nselectorA {\r\n    color: $primary;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis doesn’t work because $primary is not defined in the scope (inside the same `{ }`) nor globally.\r\n```scss\r\n// SCSS\r\nselectorA {\r\n    $primary: #ff69b4;\r\n    color: $primary;\r\n}\r\nselectorB {\r\n    background-color: $primary;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd this doesn’t work for the same reason.\r\n```scss\r\n// SCSS\r\nselectorA {\r\n    $primary: #ff69b4;\r\n    color: $primary;\r\n}\r\nselectorA {\r\n    background-color: $primary;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBoth return\r\n```\r\n@error:7 Undefined variable.\r\n  ╷\r\n7 │     background-color: $primary;\r\n  │                       ^^^^^^^^\r\n  ╵\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is **different** from CSS custom properties (“variables”) because they are set to any **element** that matches the selector so this works:\r\n```css\r\n/* CSS */\r\nselectorA {\r\n    --primary: #ff69b4;\r\n    color: var(--primary);\r\n}\r\nselectorA {\r\n    background-color: var(--primary);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* and even this works if selectorB selects the same element as selectorA */\r\nselectorB {\r\n    background-color: var(--primary);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCSS is applied to elements at runtime. Sass is compiled before, without any knowledge of elements in the so even in the case of the same selector it just doesn’t “connect the dots”.\r\n\r\nYou can [check the example in Sass playground](https://sass-lang.com/playground/#eJwzNCxOzUlNLskvclSo5lJQUCkoysxNLKq0UihKTbEGCiTn5+QXWcHFrblqubhQtSQlJmenF+WX5qXoYioGAOo/H9o=).\r\n\r\nSo you can’t just define `data-bs-theme=\"custom\"] { sass variables here }` and call it a day as they are available only inside that part of your code.",

    "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nWhile looking at our Drupal sites, which are utilizing Bootstrap 5.3, I came across an issue with the layout breaking when using some elements with some x styles/attributes in the main content area (I haven't really been able to put my finger on it). \r\n\r\nOur pages are arranged using grid like:\r\n\r\n| `div.sidebar.sidebar-first.col-md-3.order-md-first` | | `main.col.main-content` | | `div.sidebar.sidebar-second.col-md-3.order-md-last` |\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat happens is for some types of content in the main-content area of the page, like we use a Paragraph bundle for image slideshows which are responsive and will size down as needed, it breaks the layout so that it looks like:\r\n\r\n| `div.sidebar.sidebar-first.col-md-3.order-md-first` |\r\n| `main.col.main-content` |\r\n| `div.sidebar.sidebar-second.col-md-3.order-md-last` |\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter hitting my head on my desk for a while trying to figure out what exactly is breaking this layout, I found that if I use the following CSS then everything appears as it should:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.row > * {\r\n  min-width: 1px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith my CSS tweak:\r\n<img width=\"1345\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 1 52 38 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27d1554a-bc20-43af-968e-64c96768ddc4\">\r\n\r\nwithout my CSS tweak:\r\n<img width=\"1627\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 1 53 34 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5c12332-635d-4d72-bdfe-9cc0415623e9\">\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, changing the selector from `.row > *` to `main#content` also looks to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nFew questions...\r\n\r\n1. Has anyone else encountered this?\r\n2. Is this maybe something that is missing from Bootstrap out-of-the-box?\r\n3. Does anyone see any issues with using this in a production environment? I haven't come across anything that visually stands out on any page.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! :)\r\n",

We can link using hash fragments so the screen scrolls to a specific ID without issue, but when we want to link to a closed accordion using its ID the accordion does not open. I've come up with a simple JS script to embed on pages we are linking to that have accordions in order to open them automatically:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function() {\r\n  // Get the hash from the URL\r\n  const hash = window.location.hash;\r\n\r\n  if (hash) {\r\n    // Find the button related to the hash\r\n    const buttonElement = document.querySelector(hash + ' .accordion-button');\r\n\r\n    if (buttonElement) {\r\n      // Trigger a click on the button to open the accordion\r\n      buttonElement.click();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore we commit this for our sites, I was wondering two things:\r\n\r\n1. Are there any potential issues anyone notices with using this with 5.3? I haven't ran into any issues doing some basic manual testing, but maybe there's something that could cause problems with Bootstrap?\r\n2. Are there plans for something like this to be incorporated in a later release of Bootstrap, or is there something already available in 5.3 that I just couldn't find?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance! :)",

    "title": "Inconsistent behavior of Scrollspy after 5.2 update",
    "body": "Dear all,\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Scrollspy in 5.2 highlights different items depending on scroll direction, in particular items above the screen when scrolling up.\r\n\r\nI'm currently updating a project from 5.1.3 to 5.2.0 and I can't get Scrollspy to work in the same way. I have a page which has two DIVs next to each other. The left-hand side DIV contains the NAV menu (table of contents), the right-hand side DIV contains an HTML document. The HTML document (pulled from a database) can become quite lengthy with many sections, so the table of contents may become so long that both DIVs are scrollable. Consequently, the \"spy\" is not on the body, but on the DIV with the actual content.\r\n\r\nWith 5.1.3, the two DIVs were set up as:\r\n`<nav id=\"navbar-minutes\" class=\"navbar navbar-light>`\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n`<div class=\"containter-meeting-minutes\" data-bs-spy=\"scroll\" data-bs-target=\"#navbar-minutes\" data-bs-offset=\"160\">`\r\n\r\nRespectively. This worked consistently with 5.1.3 (at least in Chrome and Safari) that when scrolling either way, whatever section was at the top of the right-hand side DIV, was highlighted in the NAV menu on the left. Also, when clicking on a link in the NAV menu, the right-hand side scrolled to the right position, and again the corresponding on the left was highlighted correctly.\r\n\r\nWith 5.2.0, I have changed the the second DIVs definition to:\r\n`<div class=\"containter-meeting-minutes\" data-bs-spy=\"scroll\" data-bs-target=\"#navbar-minutes\" data-bs-root-margin=\"160px 0px 0px 0px\">`\r\n\r\nBut the behavior is very different:\r\n- When scrolling down, whatever section just enters at the bottom of the DIV gets highlighted in the table of contents, instead of when it reaches the top. So when I click on a section, and it is a shorter section (more than once section visible on the screen), it may happen that the highlighting in the NAV menu is one or two items below from where I clicked.\r\n- When scrolling up, the section that is highlighted is the one that just enters the top of the screen, even before it enters the top of the DIV.\r\n- When scrolling up and down alternately in an area of the document where there are three short sections visible on the screen, the highlighting in the table of contents jumps up and down by 4-5 menu entries at once, because it jumps from the section at the bottom of the DIV when scrolling down to the section at (above) the top of the DIV when scrolling up, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThrough trial and error, I have now set it to:\r\n`<div class=\"containter-meeting-minutes\" data-bs-spy=\"scroll\" data-bs-target=\"#navbar-minutes\" data-bs-root-margin=\"160px 0px -90% 0px\">`\r\n\r\nThis probably breaks the system since I've just moved the bottom margin to very close to the top of my DIV. But at least this gives me very close to the intended behavior when scrolling down, either by scrolling or by clicking on a table of contents entry further down. The section that is highlighted by scrollspy now consistently is the one at or near the top of the right-hand side DIV. WooHoo!\r\n\r\nBut the highlighting still is all over the place when scrolling up. The section that gets highlighted is always above the visible area. \r\n\r\nIt feels like the margin isn't applied when scrolling up, only when scrolling down.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nAfter scrolling down, the section at the top of the screen is correctly highlighted:\r\n![scrolling_down](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66065605/184544685-26a061ff-c379-43c7-8e3d-d38f3ca6d290.png)\r\n\r\nAfter scrolling up (here by clicking on the menu item highlighted in grey), the section highlighted by scrollspy is two items above. The corresponding section is well above the visible area.\r\n![scrolling_up](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66065605/184544715-782bf380-be59-4c79-b65e-4b6e4086d4de.png)\r\n\r\nNote: the DIV the scrollspy is on is the white area on the right. The 160px offset/top margin accommodates the fixed headings. \r\n\r\nMaybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I'm using it for something it's not intended for. In any case, I'd appreciate any ideas. Thanks!",

        "body": "Hi @Vandan1423 ,\r\n\r\nThe responsiveness issue in Safari might be related to the CSS or JavaScript. Here's a quick checklist with code suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. **Viewport Meta Tag**: Ensure your viewport tag is correctly set. Yours looks good:\r\n   ```html\r\n   <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Flexbox and Grid CSS**: Double-check the Bootstrap classes used for layout. Sometimes, Safari has issues with flex properties. Here’s a simplified structure:\r\n   ```html\r\n   <div class=\"container\">\r\n       <div class=\"row\">\r\n           <div class=\"col-sm-5 col-md-3 mb-3\">...</div>\r\n           <div class=\"col-sm-5 col-md-3 mb-3\">...</div>\r\n           <div class=\"col-sm-10 col-md-3 mb-3\">...</div>\r\n       </div>\r\n   </div>\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **CSS Reset**: Sometimes a CSS reset helps:\r\n   ```css\r\n   * {\r\n       margin: 0;\r\n       padding: 0;\r\n       box-sizing: border-box;\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. **Inspect Element**: Use Safari’s Developer Tools (Right-click > Inspect Element) to check for any CSS conflicts.\r\n\r\n5. **Update Safari**: Ensure that you're using the latest version of Safari as compatibility can vary.\r\n\r\nIf issues persist, consider sharing the specific parts of your CSS that might be causing layout problems.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Here are the alternatives you can use:\r\n\r\n1. **Print**: Instead of `@import \"../../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/print\";`, you can use Bootstrap's built-in print utility classes in your HTML and customize your print styles using CSS.\r\n\r\n2. **Media**: The media utilities have been integrated into the core Bootstrap CSS, so you can use the responsive utility classes directly in your HTML.\r\n\r\n3. **Jumbotron**: The jumbotron has been replaced with the `hero` component in Bootstrap 5. You can use the `.hero` class instead.\r\n\r\n4. **Custom Forms**: Bootstrap 5 has restructured form components, so you should replace `@import \"../../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/custom-forms\";` with the appropriate form classes from the new documentation.\r\n\r\n5. **Code**: For code styling, use the new syntax highlighting classes provided by Bootstrap, like `.bg-dark` and `.text-white` for code blocks.\r\n\r\nMake sure to check the [Bootstrap 5 migration guide](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/migration/) for detailed changes and how to adapt your styles accordingly.  \r\n\r\nThanks!",

    "title": "Automatically Remove Unused CSS and JavaScript Code in Bootstrap Builds",
    "body": "\r\nCurrently, Bootstrap includes all of its CSS and JavaScript code in the production build, even if not all of the code is used by the application. This can lead to larger page sizes and slower loading times. Tailwind CSS addresses this issue by automatically removing unused CSS code during the production build process.\r\n\r\nWe propose implementing a similar feature for Bootstrap to automatically remove unused CSS and JavaScript code during the production build process. This would improve page performance and provide a more consistent development experience with Tailwind CSS.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\n* **Reduced page size:** By removing unused code, the production build size of Bootstrap would be significantly smaller, leading to faster loading times.\r\n* **Improved performance:** Smaller page sizes translate to improved page performance, providing a better user experience.\r\n* **Consistent development experience:** The ability to automatically remove unused code would align Bootstrap with Tailwind CSS in terms of development workflow and optimization techniques.\r\n\r\n**Implementation:**\r\n\r\nThe feature could be implemented using a tool like PurgeCSS or UnCSS. These tools analyze the HTML and CSS files to identify which CSS selectors are actually used and remove the unused ones. For JavaScript, a similar tool could be used to analyze the JavaScript code and remove unused code.\r\n\r\n**Additional considerations:**\r\n\r\n* **Whitelist mechanism:** To ensure that critical Bootstrap components are not removed, a whitelist mechanism could be implemented. This would allow developers to specify which CSS selectors and JavaScript code should always be included in the production build.\r\n* **Configuration options:** The feature could provide configuration options to control the level of optimization. For example, developers might want to choose to remove only unused CSS selectors or to also remove unused JavaScript code.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this feature would be a valuable addition to Bootstrap and would help to improve the performance and development experience of Bootstrap projects.\r\n![IMG_20231129_232844](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/assets/59386700/d3908df4-5feb-4f2c-a777-0f35f0a2d8db)\r\n",

I know this is already possible with some other extensions like https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zignd.html-css-class-completion but would make sense for it to be included.\r\n- **Lightweight linting of HTML templates** - [Bootlint](https://github.com/twbs/bootlint) is deprecated now, but it used to be useful for catching HTML issues with Bootstrap component. Could be good to resurrect some of the rules from this.\r\n- **Autocomplete values for `data-bs-` HTML**. e.g. type`data-bs-t` and it'll suggest autocompleting to `data-bs-toggle` (I guess some of this is already available via AI extensions like GitHub Copilot, but not everyone has access to that)\r\n- **Warnings in console about using deprecated features / classes**\r\n- **Automatically remove redundant CSS classes from templates**, e.g. \"col-9 col-md-9\" is replaced with \"col-9\" - like https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AgustinFornio.redundanty (great plugin by the way!)\r\n- Autosuggesting updating older version CDN links. e.g. if you are loading https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css - it could show a note in the console that 5.3.3. is available (maybe could right click on it to auto-fix!)\r\n- All the above could be configurable in the options.\r\n\r\nI've done a little bit of maintenance of VS Code extensions before but I don't have enough experience/knowledge to build this myself from scratch.
